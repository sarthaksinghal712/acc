00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.570
A man is but the product of his thoughts

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:11.389
what he thinks he becomes. 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.160
What is the relevance of Gandhi in this

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.039
all-pervading materialistic agnostic and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.040
consumerist culture? It is precisely

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.349
these three tendencies Gandhi fought all

00:00:22.349 -->00:00:25.710
his life. The name of Mahatma Gandhi

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.110
transcends the bounds of race, religion

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.300
and nation and has emerged as the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.600
prophetic voice of the 21st century.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.219
He is remembered for his passionate

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.750
adherence to the practice of

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.380
non-violence and his supreme humanism. He

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.449
successfully demonstrated to a world

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.649
weary with wars and continuing

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:44.309
destruction that adherence to truth and

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.929
non-violence is not meant for individual

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.999
behavior alone but can be applied in

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.699
global affairs too. Although it is true

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.499
that in year has been an integrated

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:58.230
nation since olden times, it is also true

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.390
that on the present context Gandhian

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.309
values have special significance for

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.980
national integration. Today communal

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.690
amity has become essential for national

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.210
integration and hence, Gandhi gave it the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.750
highest priority. Mahatma Gandhi

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.460
instilled in us the qualities of

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.280
politics with principles; wealth with work;

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.100
commerce with morality; education with character; 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.080
pleasure with conscience;

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.020
science with humanity and worship with sacrifice.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.020
"Power to Empower", as the moto

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.700
of Digital India would proclaim,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.460
resonates with the Gandhian ideology of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.980
Modernity blending with tradition. His

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.020
thoughts regarding prosperity of all

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.420
Indians became the base of the Digital

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.910
India project. He believed that the

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.010
universality of religion can best be

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.320
realized through the universalization of

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.060
education and that it was the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.040
springboard for

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.110
national integration. Keeping these

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.600
thoughts in mind the educate Girl Child

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.760
program was a crucial and a successful

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.680
step in modern-day India,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.330
All thanks to Gandhi
